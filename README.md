# Overview

I wrote a program that uses an html form for users to be able to track their expenses. It is connected to a database using PostgreSQL.

I wrote this so that I could gain a better understanding of databases and how to interact with them.

# Relational Database

The database I am using is PostgreSQL and I have used node to connect to it with JavaScript.

The table created was an expense tracker, which contains information about different transactions.

# Development Environment

Postgres, PGAdmin, VS Code.

JavaScript, Node, HTML, JSON.

# Useful Websites

- [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc-cSSsGqbA)

# Future Work

- Create a users table, and connect it to the expenses table, so each user can only see their expenses.
- Show results in the HTML instead of just the console.
- Make more functionality for budget planning.
